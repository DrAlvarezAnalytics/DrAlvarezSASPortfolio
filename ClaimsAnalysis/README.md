# Claims-Based Adherence Analysis

This project uses simulated pharmacy claims data to evaluate medication adherence among patients prescribed oral antihypertensive medications. The analysis calculates key adherence metrics (PDC and MPR) and explores demographic differences in adherence, including racial and ethnic disparities.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Type:** Real-World Evidence (RWE) / Claims-based analysis  
- **Dataset:** Simulated patient-level pharmacy claims (951 patients)  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - SAS (data manipulation, statistical analysis)  
  - Tableau Public (data visualization)  

## 🎯 Objectives

- Compute **Proportion of Days Covered (PDC)** and **Medication Possession Ratio (MPR)**
- Identify patients who are adherent (PDC ≥ 80%)
- Analyze adherence rates across:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Payer type
  - Race/Ethnicity
- Use logistic regression to identify predictors of non-adherence
