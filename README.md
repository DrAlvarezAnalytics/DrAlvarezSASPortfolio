# Carlos Alvarez, DrPH, MPH, CPH, a-IPC | Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis and SAS programming portfolio. This repository highlights selected projects that showcase my expertise in public health data systems, ELR analytics, and real-world evidence (RWE). These examples reflect my work with public health surveillance systems, electronical laboratory Reports (ELRs), and clinical trial datasets—focusing on quality, reproducibility, and actionable insights.

## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I’m a Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) with deep experience in infectious disease surveillance, SAS programming, and evaluating public health data systems. I hold certifications in SAS Base Programming, Tableau, Public Health (CPH) and Infection Control (A-IPC), and I’m currently expanding my expertise into clinical trial programming, RWE and HEOR.

## 🧰 Core Skills

- SAS (Base, Proc SQL, Macros)
- Surveillance system evaluation (CDC - NHSN and NBS)
- Data visualization (Tableau, Excel)
- Public health reporting & dashboarding
- Epidemiologic methods & health equity analysis

## 📁 Featured Projects

### 🧪 [City A HCV Data Quality Analysis](./HCV_ELR_Project)  
Used mock Electronic Lab Reporting (ELR) data for City A to evaluate completeness, detect duplicates, and summarize key fields for HCV surveillance using SAS. Additionally, assess disease ocurrence and rates in City A. Calculate significant differences in HCV detected patients according to age, race or sex in City A.

### 🧪 [Measles Vaccine Safety Surveillance (VAERS)](./VAERS_Measles_AE_Project) (in progress)  
Analyzing 2010–2024 VAERS reports for measles-containing vaccines (MMR, MMRV) to characterize adverse event patterns by age, severity, and symptom clusters. Demonstrates real-world data handling, passive surveillance analysis, and safety signal exploration.

### 🔬 [Clinical Trial Dataset Simulation](./ClinicalTrialProject) (in progress)
Created mock CDISC-compliant SDTM and ADaM datasets using SAS, and generated example Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs) for regulatory-style output. Demonstrates knowledge of trial data structure and SAS macro use.

### 💊 [Claims-Based Adherence Analysis](./ClaimsAnalysis) (in progress)
Used simulated claims data to calculate proportion of days covered (PDC) and medication possession ratio (MPR), with stratified summaries by age, sex, and payer type. Includes code and visualizations.



## 📎 Notes

- Sensitive data and full project deliverables (e.g., NHSN evaluation, raw SAS programs) are stored in a private repository and available upon request.
- This portfolio is for demonstration purposes and highlights my coding practices, public health perspective, and communication of findings.
