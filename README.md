# Carlos Alvarez, DrPH, MPH, CPH, a-IPC | Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis and SAS programming portfolio. This repository highlights selected projects that showcase my expertise in public health data systems, ELR analytics, and real-world evidence (RWE). These examples reflect my work with public health surveillance systems, electronical laboratory Reports (ELRs), and clinical trial datasets—focusing on quality, reproducibility, and actionable insights.

## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I’m a Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) with deep experience in infectious disease surveillance, SAS programming, and evaluating public health data systems. I hold certifications in SAS Base Programming, Tableau, Public Health (CPH) and Infection Control (A-IPC), and I’m currently expanding my expertise into clinical trial programming, RWE and HEOR.

## 🧰 Core Skills

- SAS (Base, Proc SQL, Macros)
- SQL (SQLiteStudio)
- Surveillance system evaluation (CDC - NHSN and NBS)
- Data visualization
- Public health reporting & dashboarding
- Epidemiologic methods & health equity analysis

## 📁 Featured Projects

### 🔬 [Clinical Trial Dataset Simulation](./ClinicalTrialProject) (in progress)
Created mock CDISC-compliant SDTM and ADaM datasets using SAS, and generated example Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs) for regulatory-style output. Demonstrates knowledge of trial data structure and SAS macro use.

### 🧪 [Measles Vaccine Safety Surveillance (VAERS)](./VAERS_Measles_AE_Project)  
Analyzing 2014–2024 VAERS reports for measles-containing vaccines (MMR, MMRV) to identify adverse event patterns by age, severity, and symptom clusters. This project demonstrates real-world data integration and passive safety surveillance using structured SQL queries, and statistical modeling for signal detection. Highlights advanced data wrangling across multiple sources and stakeholder-oriented safety analytics.

### 💊 [Claims-Based Adherence Analysis](./ClaimsAnalysis)
Analyzed simulated pharmacy claims data to calculate adherence metrics—proportion of days covered (PDC) and medication possession ratio (MPR)—with stratified summaries by age, sex, and payer type. Demonstrates foundational real-world data (RWD) analysis, medication adherence measurement, and data visualization techniques using structured claims data.

### 🧪 [City A HCV Laboratory Data Analysis](./HCV_ELR_Project)  
Analyzed mock 2022–2024 ELR data for City A to assess hepatitis C (HCV) detection patterns and seroconversions. Identified significant differences in HCV positivity by age, sex, and race, and estimated time to seroconversion. Demonstrates public health surveillance analytics, SAS-based epidemiologic modeling, and application of data quality principles.

### 📈 [Surveillance System Evaluation – NHSN MDRO/CDI](./SurveillanceSystemEvaluation)  
Evaluated the NHSN MDRO/CDI surveillance module using CDC’s guidelines for public health surveillance system evaluation. Assessed key attributes including timeliness, data quality, and usefulness to generate actionable recommendations for improving HAI surveillance. Demonstrates applied evaluation methodology, SAS programming for surveillance analysis, and translation of findings into system improvement strategies. Due to CDC data sensitivity, full deliverables are stored in a private repository and available upon request.
