# Carlos Alvarez, DrPH, MPH, CPH, a-IPC | Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis and SAS programming portfolio. This repository highlights selected projects that showcase my expertise in public health data systems, ELR analytics, and real-world evidence (RWE). These examples reflect my work with public health surveillance systems, electronical laboratory Reports (ELRs), and clinical trial datasets—focusing on quality, reproducibility, and actionable insights.

## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I’m a Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) with deep experience in infectious disease surveillance, SAS programming, and evaluating public health data systems. I hold certifications in SAS Base Programming, Tableau, Public Health (CPH) and Infection Control (A-IPC), and I’m currently expanding my expertise into clinical trial programming, RWE and HEOR.

## 🧰 Core Skills

- SAS (Base, Proc SQL, Macros)
- SQL (SQLiteStudio)
- Surveillance system evaluation (CDC - NHSN and NBS)
- Data visualization
- Public health reporting & dashboarding
- Epidemiologic methods & health equity analysis

## 📁 Featured Projects

### 🩺 [Real-World Oncology Outcomes: Trial-Style RWE Analysis](./RWEOncologyProject) (in progress)
Simulates a real-world oncology cohort study using mock claims data to mirror clinical trial workflows. This project includes cohort building with SAS/SQL, survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression), and generation of ADaM-style datasets and TLFs for regulatory-style outputs. Demonstrates integration of real-world evidence analytics with clinical trial reporting practices, survival analysis methods, and regulatory documentation preparation (SAP, DSMB report).

### 🔬 [Clinical Trial Dataset Simulation](./ClinicalTrialProject) (in progress)
Created mock CDISC-compliant SDTM and ADaM datasets using SAS for a simulated oncology clinical trial. This project includes data derived from realistic case report forms (CRFs), conversion to SDTM and ADaM, and generation of Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs) for regulatory-style outputs. Demonstrates knowledge of clinical trial data structure, SAS macro programming, and trial reporting workflows. Also serves as practice for the SAS Clinical Trials Programmer certification. 

### 🧪 [Measles Vaccine Safety Surveillance (VAERS)](./VAERS_Measles_AE_Project)  
Analyzing 2014–2024 VAERS reports for measles-containing vaccines (MMR, MMRV) to identify adverse event patterns by age, severity, and symptom clusters. This project demonstrates real-world data integration and passive safety surveillance using structured SQL queries, and statistical modeling for signal detection. Highlights advanced data wrangling across multiple sources and stakeholder-oriented safety analytics.

### 💊 [Claims-Based Adherence Analysis](./ClaimsAnalysis)
Analyzed simulated pharmacy claims data to calculate adherence metrics—proportion of days covered (PDC) and medication possession ratio (MPR)—with stratified summaries by age, sex, and payer type. Demonstrates foundational real-world data (RWD) analysis, medication adherence measurement, and data visualization techniques using structured claims data.

### 🧪 [City A HCV Laboratory Data Analysis](./HCV_ELR_Project)  
Analyzed mock 2022–2024 ELR data for City A to assess hepatitis C (HCV) detection patterns and seroconversions. Identified significant differences in HCV positivity by age, sex, and race, and estimated time to seroconversion. Demonstrates public health surveillance analytics, SAS-based epidemiologic modeling, and application of data quality principles.

### 📈 [Surveillance System Evaluation – NHSN MDRO/CDI](./SurveillanceSystemEvaluation)  
Evaluated the NHSN MDRO/CDI surveillance module using CDC’s guidelines for public health surveillance system evaluation. Assessed key attributes including timeliness, data quality, and usefulness to generate actionable recommendations for improving HAI surveillance. Demonstrates applied evaluation methodology, SAS programming for surveillance analysis, and translation of findings into system improvement strategies. Due to CDC data sensitivity, full deliverables are stored in a private repository and available upon request.




## 📎 Notes

- This portfolio is for demonstration purposes and highlights my coding practices, public health perspective, and communication of findings.
- The clinical trials and real-world evidence (RWE) oncology projects included here are personal learning projects. They were created to develop and demonstrate my understanding of biostatistics, SAS programming, CDISC standards, and real-world data analytics. These projects are not based on real client data or commercial work and are not intended to imply professional expertise in clinical trials or RWE oncology analytics. They serve as a portfolio of my self-directed learning and skills development.
