# Surveillance System Evaluation – NHSN MDRO/CDI Module

This project evaluates the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Multidrug-Resistant Organism and Clostridioides difficile Infection (MDRO/CDI) module 
using the CDC’s **Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems**. It was completed as part of my DrPH doctoral project and presented to NHSN leadership at the CDC.

## 🔍 Objective

To assess the effectiveness and performance of the NHSN MDRO/CDI surveillance system in capturing non-required Multidrug-Resistant Organisms (MDROs) across the U.S., 
with the goal of identifying areas for system improvement.

## 🧪 Methods

- **Framework:** CDC’s 2001 Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems
- **Attributes Assessed:** Simplicity, Timeliness, Data Quality, Usefulness, Flexibility, Acceptability, Representativeness, Stability
- **Data Source:** NHSN MDRO/CDI module reported data and stakeholder feedback
- **Analysis Tool:** SAS (code included)

## 📂 Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|

## 🧾 Key Deliverables

- Comprehensive evaluation of the MDRO/CDI module across key surveillance attributes
- Recommendations for improving system timeliness, data completeness, and utility
- Presentation to CDC NHSN leadership

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SAS** for data processing, summary statistics and evaluation of timeliness, representativess, Data Quality, Completeness
- **Microsoft Excel** for analyzing usefulness, stability, flexibility, and Simplicity
- **PowerPoint** for chart/visualization generation and presentation

## 🎓 Project Context

This evaluation was conducted as part of my Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) program and reflects my ongoing commitment to improving public health data systems 
through structured evaluation, stakeholder collaboration, and applied data science.
